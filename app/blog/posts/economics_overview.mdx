# My Journey Through Economic Theory: Exploring the Foundations of Modern Economics

When I first began writing about economics, I realized that traditional models weren't fully capturing the reality of our rapidly evolving digital world. This realization sparked a journey through various aspects of economic theory, leading me to develop a series of interconnected essays that explore the fundamental nature of value, trust, and technological progress in modern economics.

## The Value Creation Story

My first major exploration, ["A Theory on Value Creation"](https://github.com/kyegomez/A-Theory-on-Value-Creation), emerged from a simple question: How do we measure value in a world where the most valuable companies create products you can't touch? I found myself fascinated by the gap between traditional economic models and our current reality, where a single line of code could be worth millions, and networks could generate value simply by existing.

In this paper, I developed a framework that bridges this gap, examining how both tangible and intangible resources interact with technology and time to generate value. What excited me most was seeing how this framework could explain phenomena that traditional economics struggled with - like why some digital products become exponentially more valuable as their user base grows.

## The Neural Network Revelation

This exploration led me to one of my most ambitious works, ["Modeling Economic Systems as Neural Networks"](https://github.com/kyegomez/Modeling-Economic-Systems-as-Neural-Networks). While studying economic systems, I had an epiphany: what if we viewed the economy not as a mechanical system, but as a living, learning network? This insight opened up entirely new ways of understanding economic behavior.

In this paper, I show how treating economic agents - from individuals to corporations - as neurons in a vast network helps explain everything from market adaptation to crisis recovery. It's fascinating to see how this model captures the way economies learn and evolve, much like a brain developing new neural pathways.

## Trust: The Hidden Foundation

Perhaps my most personally meaningful work is ["Trust and Reciprocity Are the Foundations of All Economic Systems"](https://medium.com/@kyeg/trust-and-reciprocity-are-the-foundations-of-all-economic-systems-d862edd56fc0). Through my research, I discovered that trust isn't just important for economics - it's the invisible infrastructure that makes all economic activity possible.

This understanding led me to examine our current trust crisis in ["The Collapse of Public Trust: A Society in Crisis"](https://medium.com/@kyeg/the-collapse-of-public-trust-a-society-in-crisis-55926464ec2b), where I explore how eroding trust threatens not just our economic systems, but our entire social fabric.

## The Growth Imperative

In ["Grow or Die"](https://medium.com/@kyeg/grow-or-die-edb4c5db30c9), I tackle one of economics' most controversial necessities: growth. This essay emerged from my observations of how economic systems behave under stagnation. The findings challenged some of my own preconceptions about sustainable economics.

## Value Exchange and Production

My exploration of value creation naturally led to examining how value moves through economic systems. In ["The Economics of Value Exchange"](https://medium.com/@kyeg/the-economics-of-value-exchange-a-foundational-perspective-cf097e24ccb0), I detail how value flows determine economic success or failure at both individual and societal levels.

This investigation culminated in ["Wealth Creation Through Production"](https://kyegomez.com/blog/producing_value), where I argue for the fundamental importance of productive capacity in creating sustainable prosperity.

## A Living Economic System

More recently, I've been exploring how economics functions as a self-sustaining system. This work builds on my neural network model, examining how economic systems develop their own forms of intelligence through technological advancement and market mechanisms.

## Looking Forward

Economics isn't just about numbers and graphs - it's about understanding how humans create and exchange value, how societies organize themselves, and how we can build better systems for the future. Through these works, I've attempted to contribute to this understanding, but the journey is far from over. I continue to explore new aspects of economic theory and welcome engagement with others interested in these ideas.
