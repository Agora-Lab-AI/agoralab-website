# Embarking on a New Journey

I'm **Kye Gomez**, and I've been passionate about programming since I was 12 years old. Today, I have the privilege of leading **Agora**, an open-source AI research lab non-profit that unites over 8,200 researchers worldwide. Together, we've successfully trained thousands of models, continually pushing the boundaries of AI innovation.

## The Road Ahead: Our Plans for the Next Few Months

I'm thrilled to share my plans for the coming months, which revolve around an ambitious project called **Swarms**. Swarms is a framework designed to orchestrate millions of agents to automate recurring enterprise operations. Here's how we aim to make it a reality:

### 1. **Raising Funds for Swarms**

To bring Swarms to its full potential, we'll be launching a fundraising campaign. The funds will be instrumental in accelerating development, expanding our infrastructure, and deploying Swarms at scale. Your support can make a significant difference in revolutionizing how enterprises operate.

### 2. **Building the Best Team**

I'm on the lookout for talented individuals who are passionate about AI, agents, and infrastructure. Whether you're a developer, researcher, or engineer, there's a place for you in our mission to innovate. Together, we can assemble a team that's poised to make a lasting impact.

### 3. **Connecting with Investors**

We're actively seeking investors who share our vision for transforming enterprise operations through AI. If you're interested in being part of this groundbreaking journey, I'd love to connect and discuss how we can collaborate.

## Let's Connect

I'm always eager to meet like-minded individuals, investors, and collaborators. Feel free to reach out through any of the channels below:


Thank you for your continued support. Together, we can push the boundaries of what's possible and usher in a new era of AI-driven solutions.

Best regards,
